postgresql-10 (10.10-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.

    + Fixes regression in ALTER TABLE on multiple columns. (Closes: #932247)

    + Require schema qualification to cast to a temporary type when using
      functional cast syntax (Noah Misch)

      We have long required invocations of temporary functions to explicitly
      specify the temporary schema, that is pg_temp.func_name(args). Require
      this as well for casting to temporary types using functional notation,
      for example pg_temp.type_name(arg). Otherwise it's possible to capture a
      function call using a temporary object, allowing privilege escalation in
      much the same ways that we blocked in CVE-2007-2138. (CVE-2019-10208)

  * Allow overriding the startup command suggested by initdb.
    (See: #872660)

postgresql-10 (10.9-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
    + Fix buffer-overflow hazards in SCRAM verifier parsing
      (Jonathan Katz, Heikki Linnakangas, Michael Paquier)

      Any authenticated user could cause a stack-based buffer overflow by
      changing their own password to a purpose-crafted value.  In addition to
      the ability to crash the PostgreSQL server, this could suffice for
      executing arbitrary code as the PostgreSQL operating system account.

      A similar overflow hazard existed in libpq, which could allow a rogue
      server to crash a client or perhaps execute arbitrary code as the
      client's operating system account.

      The PostgreSQL Project thanks Alexander Lakhin for reporting this
      problem.  (CVE-2019-10164)

postgresql-10 (10.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
    + Prevent row-level security policies from being bypassed via selectivity
      estimators (Dean Rasheed)

      Some of the planner's selectivity estimators apply user-defined
      operators to values found in pg_statistic (e.g., most-common values).
      A leaky operator therefore can disclose some of the entries in a data
      column, even if the calling user lacks permission to read that column.
      In CVE-2017-7484 we added restrictions to forestall that, but we failed
      to consider the effects of row-level security.  A user who has SQL
      permission to read a column, but who is forbidden to see certain rows
      due to RLS policy, might still learn something about those rows'
      contents via a leaky operator.  This patch further tightens the rules,
      allowing leaky operators to be applied to statistics data only when
      there is no relevant RLS policy.  (CVE-2019-10130)

postgresql-10 (10.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
    + Fix failure to reset libpq's state fully between connection attempts

      An unprivileged user of dblink or postgres_fdw could bypass the checks
      intended to prevent use of server-side credentials, such as a ~/.pgpass
      file owned by the operating-system user running the server.  Servers
      allowing peer authentication on local connections are particularly
      vulnerable.  Other attacks such as SQL injection into a postgres_fdw
      session are also possible. Attacking postgres_fdw in this way requires
      the ability to create a foreign server object with selected connection
      parameters, but any user with access to dblink could exploit the
      problem. In general, an attacker with the ability to select the
      connection parameters for a libpq-using application could cause
      mischief, though other plausible attack scenarios are harder to think
      of. Our thanks to Andrew Krasichkov for reporting this issue.
      (CVE-2018-10915)

    + Fix INSERT ... ON CONFLICT UPDATE through a view that isn't just SELECT
      FROM ...

      Erroneous expansion of an updatable view could lead to crashes or
      attribute ... has the wrong type errors, if the view's SELECT list
      doesn't match one-to-one with the underlying table's columns.
      Furthermore, this bug could be leveraged to allow updates of columns
      that an attacking user lacks UPDATE privilege for, if that user has
      INSERT and UPDATE privileges for some other column(s) of the table. Any
      user could also use it for disclosure of server memory. (CVE-2018-10925)

postgresql-10 (10.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.

    If you run an installation in which not all users are mutually
    trusting, or if you maintain an application or extension that is
    intended for use in arbitrary situations, it is strongly recommended
    that you read the documentation changes described in the first changelog
    entry below, and take suitable steps to ensure that your installation or
    code is secure.

    Also, the changes described in the second changelog entry below may
    cause functions used in index expressions or materialized views to fail
    during auto-analyze, or when reloading from a dump.  After upgrading,
    monitor the server logs for such problems, and fix affected functions.

    + Document how to configure installations and applications to guard
      against search-path-dependent trojan-horse attacks from other users

      Using a search_path setting that includes any schemas writable by a
      hostile user enables that user to capture control of queries and then
      run arbitrary SQL code with the permissions of the attacked user.  While
      it is possible to write queries that are proof against such hijacking,
      it is notationally tedious, and it's very easy to overlook holes.
      Therefore, we now recommend configurations in which no untrusted schemas
      appear in one's search path.
      (CVE-2018-1058)

    + Avoid use of insecure search_path settings in pg_dump and other client
      programs

      pg_dump, pg_upgrade, vacuumdb and other PostgreSQL-provided applications
      were themselves vulnerable to the type of hijacking described in the
      previous changelog entry; since these applications are commonly run by
      superusers, they present particularly attractive targets.  To make them
      secure whether or not the installation as a whole has been secured,
      modify them to include only the pg_catalog schema in their search_path
      settings. Autovacuum worker processes now do the same, as well.

      In cases where user-provided functions are indirectly executed by these
      programs -- for example, user-provided functions in index expressions --
      the tighter search_path may result in errors, which will need to be
      corrected by adjusting those user-provided functions to not assume
      anything about what search path they are invoked under.  That has always
      been good practice, but now it will be necessary for correct behavior.

postgresql-10 (10.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.
    + Fix processing of partition keys containing multiple expressions
      (CVE-2018-1052)

    + Ensure that all temporary files made by pg_upgrade are
      non-world-readable (CVE-2018-1053)

    + Change the behavior of contrib/cube's cube ~> int operator to make it
      compatible with KNN search.

      The meaning of the second argument (the dimension selector) has been
      changed to make it predictable which value is selected even when
      dealing with cubes of varying dimensionalities.

      This is an incompatible change, but since the point of the operator
      was to be used in KNN searches, it seems rather useless as-is.
      After installing this update, any expression indexes or materialized
      views using this operator will need to be reindexed/refreshed.

postgresql-10 (10.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.

    + Ensure that INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE checks table permissions
      and RLS policies in all cases (Dean Rasheed)

      The update path of INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE requires SELECT
      permission on the columns of the arbiter index, but it failed to check
      for that in the case of an arbiter specified by constraint name. In
      addition, for a table with row level security enabled, it failed to
      check updated rows against the table's SELECT policies (regardless of
      how the arbiter index was specified). (CVE-2017-15099)

    + Fix crash due to rowtype mismatch in json{b}_populate_recordset()
      (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

      These functions used the result rowtype specified in the FROM ... AS
      clause without checking that it matched the actual rowtype of the
      supplied tuple value.  If it didn't, that would usually result in a
      crash, though disclosure of server memory contents seems possible as
      well. (CVE-2017-15098)

    + Fix BRIN index summarization to handle concurrent table extension
      correctly (Álvaro Herrera)

      Previously, a race condition allowed some table rows to be omitted from
      the index.  It may be necessary to reindex existing BRIN indexes to
      recover from past occurrences of this problem.

  * Remove empty conf.d directory on purge, even when postgresql-common was
    already removed. (Closes: #877264)
  * Remove docbook-dsssl and openjade from Build-Depends, not needed anymore.
