  If you run an installation where the users are mutually trusting or if you
  maintain an application or extension that is intended for use in arbitrary
  situations, it is highly recommended that you read the release notes
  regarding changes around "search_path", and take suitable steps to ensure
  that your installation or code is secure:

    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/release-10-3.html#id-1.11.6.5.5

  In addition, these changes may cause functions used in index expressions or
  materialized views to fail during auto-analyze or when reloading from a dump.
  After upgrading, please monitor the server logs for such problems and fix any
  affected functions.
