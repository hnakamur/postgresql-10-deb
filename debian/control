Description: object-relational SQL database, version 10 server
 PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database
 system. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign
 keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple
 languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER,
 NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It
 also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures,
 sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++,
 Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and
 exceptional documentation.
 .
 This package provides the database server for PostgreSQL 10.
